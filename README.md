A standalone Max 7 patch specially built for a short performance at a dear friend's wedding.

# Features

* granular cloud synthesis from loaded sample

  * we recommend a sample of the chords to 'White Wedding' by Billy Idol, played languidly and at half-time on the neck pickup of a Fender Jaguar

* random stutter repeat effect

* spectral blurring/freezing effect

* 4 drunken walk 'LFOs' to modulate parameters on synth and effects

  * *very* slow tempo suggested

* matrix routing of modulation data

* live input sampling (maybe sometime)

# Required packages

* Petra (available on Max 7 package manager) provides the granular synthesis engine

* LowKeyNW (ditto) provides ``nw.gverb~`` reverb external

* AudioMix (ditto) provides mixer/routing abstractions
